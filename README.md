# Introduction To Python

## Objective
Build the command line version of a Recipe App that takes advantage of Python’s object-oriented nature. 

### User Goals
Users should be able to create and modify recipes with ingredients, cooking time, and a difficulty parameter that would be automatically calculated by the app. Your users should also be able to search for recipes by their ingredients.

### Key Features
- Create and manage the user’s recipes on a locally hosted MySQL database.
- Option to search for recipes that contain a set of ingredients specified by the user.
- Automatically rate each recipe by its difficulty level.
- Display more details on each recipe if the user prompts it, such as the ingredients, cooking time, and difficulty of the recipe.

### Project Deliverables

_Follow along with each stage of the project by navigating to the exercise folders in the repository_

#### Exercise 1: Intro to Python Programming
- Install Python on macOS, Windows, or Linux
- Create and manage virtual environments
- Use pip to install and manage packages

#### Exercise 2: Data Types in Python
- Use data types and methods to execute Python commands that store recipes containing their own internal data
- Enter a number of these recipes into another linear data structure

#### Exercise 3: Functions and Other Operations in Python
- Implement conditional statements in Python to determine program flow
- Use loops to reduce time and effort in Python programming
- Write functions to organize Python code

#### Exercise 4: File Handling in Python
- Use files to store and retrieve data in Python

#### Exercise 5: Object-Oriented Programming in Python
- Apply object-oriented programming concepts to your Recipe app

#### Exercise 6: Databases in Python
- Create a MySQL database for your Recipe app

#### Exercise 7: Object-Relational Mapping in Python
-	Interact with a database using an object-relational mapper
-	Build your final command-line Recipe application
